***Jawari Legio***

This is a port of the VCV Rack module Jawari to the Noise Engineering Legio platform. Jawari is a Tanpura machine, a model of the Indian drone instrument. On a tanpura, there are four strings which are plucked in order to create a continuous drone sound. 

**Controls**

*Top encoder*: Tuning. You can fine tune the frequency by tuning the encoder. If you push and turn you will tune in greater increments. You can also send v/oct pitch CV into the A jack. This signal is additive with the encoder position. 

*Middle knob*: This controls the jawari shape. The "jawari" refers to the shape of the bridge that the strings interact with to produce the characteristic buzzy sound. The specific shape of this bridge can produce different sound quality. In this module, that parameter is controlled by the middle knob and the "B" CV jack. 

*Bottom knob*: This is a simple low-pass filter. The knob and the "C" jack control cutoff frequency. 

The sound is mono, so L and R output jacks deliver the same signal. 

The L and R input jacks do nothing.
